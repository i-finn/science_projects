This script take an n-level quantum system and numerically calculates its response to an arbitrary classical electric field, given a set of electric dipole coupling strengths between levels. It is a very simple discrete time step solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, and shouldn't be used for long timescales (>20 picoseconds) as the error becomes quite large. It plots the output induced polarization, output electric field, and the Fourier transform of the output.
