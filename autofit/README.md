This was a somewhat longer project that evolved into a collaboration at three institutions (New College, UVa, Caltech). The basic idea is an automated spectral assigner of molecular rotational spectra. The algorithm was proposed and first implemented by the Pate lab at UVa in ptc mathcad. Prof. Steve Shipman and I developed a separate version in python and successfully used it to automatically fit many different spectra. It started as a section of my undergraduate thesis, but we continued to improve the code while I was at Caltech. Nathan Seifert and the Pate lab at UVa put together an excellent set of documentation for the program (linked above), added some extra features, and also benchmarked it on the molecule hexanal. These results are presented in this publication:
