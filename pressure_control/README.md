I wrote this program to keep a constant pressure in a gas cell while taking data on the gas. The program reads the pressure from a pressure gauge and then adjusts a valve with a cheap remote control hobby servo using an arduino. I used the aruino control software from [here](https://github.com/vdupain/arduino-sketchbook/tree/master/MultipleSerialServoControl)
