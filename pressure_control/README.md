I wrote this program to keep a constant pressure in a gas cell while taking data on the gas. The program reads the pressure from a pressure gauge over serial communication and then adjusts a valve with a hobby servo using an arduino. I used the arduino control software from [here](https://github.com/vdupain/arduino-sketchbook/tree/master/MultipleSerialServoControl)
