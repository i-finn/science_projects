# Description
I wrote this program to keep a constant pressure in the waveguide microwave spectrometer at New College of Florida. The program reads the pressure from a pressure gauge over serial communication and then adjusts a valve with a hobby servo using an arduino to change the pumpout speed from the gas cell. I used the arduino control software from [here](https://github.com/vdupain/arduino-sketchbook/tree/master/MultipleSerialServoControl)
