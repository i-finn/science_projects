I wrote this script for the microwave spectrometer at Caltech. See the interface below. It uses tkinter to generate a simple GUI. Time domain data is read in from a file and the user can select a particular time window. The time domain data is zero padded and apodized, then the discrete fast Fourier transform is calculated and displayed.
