These are some scripts for predicting 2D spectra in a n-level system using a reduced density matrix formalism. The time evolution is calculated with a discrete time step solution to the Liouvilleâ€“von Neumann equation. I wrote the initial version (shown here) and Dr. Ralph Welsch (now at Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, Hamburg, Germany) added more features and generally improved the code, which we used for analyzing experimental data in two publications. Please see the first PNAS paper for a detailed description of the code and application. I wrote the matlab data processing scripts with Dr. Marco Allodi (now at University of Chicago).
