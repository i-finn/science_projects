I wrote this program with help from Dr. Steve Shipman (New College of Florida) to fit rotational spectra. We never quite finished the program, as it had enough functionality to be pretty useful. It uses PyQT4 and matplotlib to generate the GUI. My coworkers and I used it extensively (along with autofit) to analyze data from the Caltech microwave spectrometer. A screenshot is shown below. Here is a walkthrough of the features:
