# Description
I wrote this program with Prof. Steve Shipman (New College of Florida) to fit rotational spectra. We never quite finished the program and it still has a few bugs. It was probably the most useful script in my PhD thesis work as it allowed me to rapidly analyze results from autofit and do the final spectral fits. It uses PyQT4 and matplotlib to generate the GUI. My coworkers and I used it extensively (along with autofit) to analyze data from the Caltech microwave spectrometer. A screenshot is shown below. Here is a walkthrough of the features:
